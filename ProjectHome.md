This program allows you to create bitmaps and fonts, and transform them to "C" source format.

_**Project has been fully rewritten on Qt. New version can be found here: [lcd-image-converter](http://code.google.com/p/lcd-image-converter)**_

Fonts and images are stored in xml format. Conversion to result file is made with help of xsl transformation. You can edit the xsl templates to obtain any desired result format.
